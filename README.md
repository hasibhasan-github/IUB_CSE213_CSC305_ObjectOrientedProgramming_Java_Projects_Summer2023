Welcome to the Java OOP Projects Collection repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of all the projects completed during the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at Independent University Bangladesh.

Notice: As there are multiple projects, each residing on separate branches, kindly verify the arrangement accordingly.Thank you! **

The OOP course at IUB provides a solid foundation in Java programming, focusing on the principles of object-oriented design, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Throughout the course, students acquire essential skills in building robust, modular, and scalable applications using Java and JavaFx.

In this repository, you will find a diverse range of Java projects that demonstrate proficiency in OOP concepts. Each project represents a practical application of the knowledge gained during the course, highlighting your ability to design efficient algorithms, implement object-oriented designs, and effectively solve real-world problems using Java.
